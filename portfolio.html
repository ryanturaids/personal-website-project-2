                <h2>High School Narrative Film</h2>
                <p>
                    In high school I produced a narrative short film titled "Burnt Out." Its storyline follows the protagonist grappling with outrageous
                    challenges imposed by his boss, roommate, and life itself. This relentless pressure eventually pushes him to a mental breaking point,
                    causing him to go off the deep end. Uncoincidentally, his journey mirrors my own experience of the creative process while making
                    the film.

                    <h2>This One Time I Made a Donut</h2>
                    <p>
                        My very first (and only) stab at 3D modeling; a Donut! Created in Blender, where beginners infamously make donuts to get the grips of
                        the program, my donut features the equally infamous pink frosting and colored sprinkles. I'm very proud of this donut.
