                    <h2>Hey, I'm Ryan!</h2>
                    <p>
                        I used to sell closets, now I'm looking forward to building applications and websites. I've spent most my life in California
                        along with a brief stint in Texas, and while I am a homebody I occasionally have the urge to travel and explore. I enjoy using
                        tech but have always hated the feeling of not understanding what's under the hood. For a long time I've been looking forward
                        peeling back the curtain!

                    <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love solving problems and making those solutions self-correcting. In my career, I've spent a lot of time automating tasks at
                        work. When these solutions got too complicated for me I tried teaching myself better methods, but quickly hit walls when anything
                        beyond basic algebra and Excel-functions got involved. Lacking structure and trying to learn was like trying to decipher
                        hieroglyphics in another language. I could always figure out chunks of how something worked, but never was able to figure out how
                        to connect it all functionally. After realizing that I find more satisfaction in building and improving systems than in using
                        them, I want to shift my career-path entirely. This is a ground floor for me, and with work secured in this field I plan on
                        diving fully into every area of programming and development I can wrap my mind around.
